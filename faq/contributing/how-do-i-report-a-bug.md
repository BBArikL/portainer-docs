# How do I report a bug?

If you find a bug, please tell us so we can triage it. All bugs are managed in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=bug%2Fneed-confirmation%2C+kind%2Fbug\&template=Bug\_report.md\&title=). When you click through, our template makes it easy to record all of the details. Before you report a bug, please check our list of [open bugs](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2Fbug) in case someone else has already reported it.
