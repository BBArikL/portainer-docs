# My Portainer Extensions license has expired. What can I do?

In December 2020, Portainer stopped the extensions program as part of the release of Portainer 2.0. The RBAC, External Authentication and Registry Management capabilities offered with extensions was replaced with the dedicated Business Edition. The 1.24.x code base reached the end of itâ€™s End of Life process on December 31, 2021.&#x20;

#### **What does End of Life for 1.24.x and Extensions products mean?**

* The 1.24.x image will be permanently removed from Docker Hub therefore if the original image is required (ever), it will need to have been locally stored by the user prior to that date.
* Any and all effort to update or maintain the 1.24.x codebase by the Portainer Team will cease. This includes the addressing of any new security vulnerabilities identified by the community.
* The source code will be archived in GitHub.

As a Portainer Extensions user, you have two options:

## Option 1: 5 Nodes Free

If you have 5 nodes or less in your environment, we can send you a license for 5 Portainer Business nodes free. Please [complete the form](https://www.portainer.io/pb5-free-node-program-early-access-invite) and our team will be in touch.
