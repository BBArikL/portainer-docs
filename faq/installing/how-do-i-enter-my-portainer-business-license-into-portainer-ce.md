# How do I enter my Portainer Business license into Portainer CE?

Due to the differences between Portainer features and versions, we don't provide a way to enter a Portainer Business license directly into Portainer CE. Instead, [switch images from CE to BE](../../start/upgrade/tobe/) then enter your trial license to get all the functionality of BE. You should experience no data loss when switching the images over.
