# What information does Portainer collect?

So we focus our efforts in the right places, we need to know which features get used most often. We use Matamo Analytics to get this information. Matamo Analytics is hosted in Germany and is fully [GDPR-compliant](https://gdpr.eu).

When Portainer first starts, you are given the option to disable analytics. If you choose not to disable analytics, we will collect anonymous usage statistics (as per our [privacy policy](https://www.portainer.io/privacy-policy)). We do not store or send any personally identifiable information at any time, and we only use the data collected to improve Portainer.
