# Welcome

Welcome to Portainer's official documentation site.

## About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition (CE) is our foundation. With over half a million regular users, CE is a powerful, open source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

Portainer Business Edition (BE) is our commercial offering. With features geared towards businesses and larger organizations such as [Role-Based Access Control](admin/users/roles.md), [registry management](admin/registries/browse.md), and [dedicated support](./#getting-support), Portainer BE is a powerful toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

{% hint style="info" %}
Portainer Business Edition requires a license key to install and use. If you don't currently have a license key, you can [request five nodes free](https://www.portainer.io/pricing/take5) of Portainer Business Edition or purchase Portainer Business Edition for your organization by [contacting our Success team](mailto:success@portainer.io).
{% endhint %}

Portainer hides the complexity of managing containers behind an easy-to-use UI. By removing the need to use the CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so easy that anyone can do it.

Our team is here to help you on your journey. Community and five nodes free users can get assistance through our [community support channels](./#community-edition), and paid Business customers through our [business support channels](./#business-edition).

## Documentation

We're working hard to ensure that our documentation keeps up with our ever-growing Portainer community. If you have a question or a task, we encourage you to start with the documentation (right here!). If you can't find what you're looking for, please visit one of our support channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
As an open source product we rely on users in our community to support one another by asking questions, engaging in discussions and sharing knowledge. Together with the documentation found on this site and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7diMJcrULjDseq5yhSUZgg), we cover a lot of ground but there may be gaps.

## Getting support

### Community Edition

Community Edition and five nodes free customers can get support through the following channels:

* **Ask questions** either in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues) or the [community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/portainer/shared\_invite/zt-txh3ljab-52QHTyjCqbe5RibC2lcjKA). Other platforms exist (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow) but we are less active in those spaces.
* **Log bugs** in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues) so they can be properly managed.
* **Flag vulnerabilities** by emailing [security@portainer.io](mailto:security@portainer.io) so we can deal with them immediately.
* **Flag documentation issues** via our [GitHub documentation channel](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-docs/issues) (or start [contributing](contribute/contribute.md) and make our documentation better!).

### Business Edition

As a Portainer Business Edition customer, you can log tickets directly with our team via [email](mailto:businesssupport@portainer.io) or filling out the [Request Support form](https://www.portainer.io/portainer-business-support). You can report a bug, ask a question, tell us about an issue with documentation, or request a feature. Tickets are checked and resolved by Portainer staff within the SLA.
