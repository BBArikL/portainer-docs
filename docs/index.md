## :fontawesome-solid-address-card: About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition 2.0 is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over half a million regular users, it’s a powerful, open source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Azure ACI.

Portainer hides the complexity of managing containers behind an easy to use GUI. By removing the need to use the CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so simple that anyone can do it.

The Portainer development team is here to assist you on your container journey. You can engage with them any time through our community-based support channels.

## :material-comment-account: Support Channels
  
As a free and open source product, we have been heavily reliant on our community to provide "how to" support to our community, recently, we have invested significant time in improving and updating our documentation found on this site and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7diMJcrULjDseq5yhSUZgg). While we endeavour to cover as many scenarios as possible, there may be some that our documentation doesn’t cover. 

* <b>QUESTIONS</b> should be posted to either [Github Issues](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues) or to the [community Slack channel](https://portainer.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDk3ODQ5MjI2MjI4LTcwNGYxMWQ5OGViYWZkNDY2ZjY4YTMwMTgzYmU4YmNiOTU0MDcxYmJjNTIyYmQ0MTM5Y2QwNTg3NzNkMTk5MDg#/). While we offer other platforms for questions (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow) the Portainer team will be less active in these.
