# After an update, why doesnâ€™t my version number match the latest version?

This is common after updating Portainer versions, and is usually caused by a cached page in your browser.

**Step 1 - Find out if caching is the problem:** Load Portainer in private/incognito mode. If it works then it means that your browser has cached the page.

**Step 2 - Fix it:** Clear your cache through the browser settings. If that doesn't work, check that the latest Portainer version installed successfully. If that doesn't work, [log a bug report](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=bug%2Fneed-confirmation%2C+kind%2Fbug\&template=Bug\_report.md\&title=).
