# Registries

A registry is a repository of container images that can be pulled and deployed on a containerized infrastructure. Portainer supports connecting registries to the Portainer Server instance, allowing you to use those registries when deploying containers.

With Portainer Business Edition you can also browse and manage your registries within Portainer itself.
