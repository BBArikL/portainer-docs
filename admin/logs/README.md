# Authentication logs

Within the Portainer Business Edition UI you can view a log of all authentication actions. The log is read-only and cannot be edited.

{% hint style="info" %}
Portainer also provides the ability to view [detailed activity logs](activity.md).
{% endhint %}

From the menu select **Authentication logs**.
