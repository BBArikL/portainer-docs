# Environments

In Portainer terms, an _environment_ is an instance that you want to manage through Portainer. Environments can be Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, ACI or a combination. One Portainer Server instance can manage multiple environments.

Environments can be organized in groups and given tags.

Access to environments can then be managed on a per-environment or per-environment group basis.
