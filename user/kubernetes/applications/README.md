# Applications

In Kubernetes, an application is a collection of configuration settings and variables required to run your app. This may consist of a single container or multiple containers with complex interoperability. Portainer lets you add and remove applications:

{% page-ref page="add.md" %}

{% page-ref page="remove.md" %}

You can also inspect a running application:

{% page-ref page="inspect.md" %}

Portainer also supports more advanced application deployment via Kubernetes manifests:

{% page-ref page="advanced.md" %}
