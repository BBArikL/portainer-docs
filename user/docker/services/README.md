# Services

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Services** menu is only available to Docker Swarm endpoints.
{% endhint %}

A service consists of an image definition and container configuration as well as instructions on how those containers will be deployed across a Swarm cluster. 

{% page-ref page="add.md" %}

{% page-ref page="configure.md" %}

Once a service has been created you can scale it to meet your needs, as well as view individual task status and logs.

{% page-ref page="scale.md" %}

{% page-ref page="tasks.md" %}

{% page-ref page="logs.md" %}

If you need to undo some changes to a service, you can roll it back:

{% page-ref page="rollback.md" %}

You can also configure webhooks for your services.

{% page-ref page="webhooks.md" %}
