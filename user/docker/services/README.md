# Services

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Services** menu is only available to Docker Swarm endpoints.
{% endhint %}

A service consists of an image definition and container configuration as well as instructions on how those containers will be deployed across a Swarm cluster.

[add.md](add.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="configure.md" %}
[configure.md](configure.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Once a service has been created you can scale it to meet your needs, as well as view individual task status and logs.

{% content-ref url="scale.md" %}
[scale.md](scale.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="tasks.md" %}
[tasks.md](tasks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="logs.md" %}
[logs.md](logs.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you need to undo some changes to a service, you can roll it back.

{% content-ref url="rollback.md" %}
[rollback.md](rollback.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also configure webhooks for your services.

{% content-ref url="webhooks.md" %}
[webhooks.md](webhooks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
