# API documentation

Portainer exposes an HTTP API that you can use to automate everything you do via the Portainer UI. You can also use Portainer as a gateway \(HTTP queries against the Portainer API\) to the underlying Docker/Kubernetes API.

You can find our API documentation at [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/portainer/portainer-ce/2.9.0). We have also provided some examples of API usage.
