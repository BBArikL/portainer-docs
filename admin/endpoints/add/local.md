# Add a local endpoint

You can only add a local endpoint when the Portainer Server container is being created. You cannot add a local endpoint after Portainer is deployed.

For more information about the installation process, visit the [Getting Started](../../../start/intro.md) section \(in particular, the [installation steps](../../../start/install/)\).
