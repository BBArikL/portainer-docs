# How do I reset my Portainer password?

If you know your current password and can log into Portainer, you can [set a new password](../../user/account-settings.md#change-user-password) via the Portainer UI. 

If you have forgotten your password or are unable to log in, either ask another Portainer admin to [reset the password](../../admin/users/password.md) for you, or use our [password reset helper](../../advanced/reset-admin.md) to reset the default admin account password \(from when Portainer was initialized\).
