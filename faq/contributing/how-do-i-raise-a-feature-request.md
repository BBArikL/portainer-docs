# How do I raise a feature request?

You can request new features in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=\&template=Feature\_request.md\&title=). When you click through, our template makes it easy to record all of the details. We also publish a [list of open feature requests](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug%2Fconfirmed) in GitHub. Check to see if someone has already requested the feature you want, and give it a thumbs up.
