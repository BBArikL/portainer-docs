# Add a DockerHub account

Portainer provides built-in support for anonymous DockerHub access, but in some cases you may need to log into DockerHub (for example, private images or to support pulling a large number of images).

From the menu select **Registries** then click **Add registry** and select **DockerHub** as the registry provider.
