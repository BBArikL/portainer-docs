# Licenses

Licensing in Portainer Business Edition is based on the [number of nodes](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes) you are managing.

From the menu select **Licenses**. The **License Information** section summarizes information about your license including how many nodes it covers and how many nodes are currently being used, as well as the license expiry date. You can click **Upgrade licenses** to purchase additional licenses.

If you want to add more nodes to your environment than your license allows, first [upgrade your license](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/how-do-i-upgrade-my-license) then click **Add license**, enter your license key then click **Submit**.
