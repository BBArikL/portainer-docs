# How do you decide which bugs and features to work on first?

Here at Portainer, we encourage feedback from our customers, and we truly value our user community. That being said, our [features](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2Fenhancement) and [bugs](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2bug) lists are long and at times seem neverending. Our decision-making process aims to balance user needs with the reality of Portainer's limited time and resources. Despite our best intentions, we know that at times we will disappoint some of you.

## Our process

When prioritizing which feature requests to work on, if we answer "yes" to any of the following questions, we will add that feature:

* Will it address a security vulnerability or potential exploitation?
* Will it have a wide appeal?
* Will it benefit professional Portainer users?
* Does the request have at least 20 thumbs-ups or hearts in GitHub?

## Feature parity

We don't automatically maintain feature parity with Docker. When a new Docker CE feature comes out, we ask the same four questions before deciding whether or not to add it to Portainer. And we only add support for features that we feel are in high demand.

## The importance of voting

We receive many feature requests for issues that exist only because of a specific use case. These stay pending until we identify an opportunity, or our community indicates its demand by voting (thumbs-up).
