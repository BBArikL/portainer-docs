# View the status of a service task

Services in a Docker Swarm environment are a collection of tasks \(or individual containers\). This procedure explains how to quickly see the status of the containers that make up a service.

From the menu select **Services** then click the down-arrow to the left of the service you want to inspect. The tasks that make up the service will be shown.

Select any individual task to go to the container details page for that task. You can also perform various actions on individual tasks by using the icons in the **Actions** column.
