# Licenses

Licensing in Portainer Business Edition is based on the [number of nodes](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes) you are managing.

From the menu select **Licenses**. The **License Information** section summarizes information about your license including how many nodes it covers and how many nodes are currently being used, as well as the license expiry date. You can click **Upgrade licenses** to purchase additional licenses.

You can also view a list of each license applied to your Portainer installation.

If you want to add more nodes to your environment than your license allows, first [upgrade your license](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/how-do-i-upgrade-my-license).

## Remove a license

To remove a license (for example when you want to remove an expired license), tick the box next to the license and click **Remove**. You will be asked to confirm the removal.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure you have enough licenses to cover the number of nodes you are using before committing to the removal. For more on how nodes are calculated, refer to [this knowledge base article](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/what-is-a-node-for-licensing-purposes).
