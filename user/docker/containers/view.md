Here you can view the container's status and details, including port configurations, environment variables, labels, attached volumes and networks, and more. You also have a number of actions available, including starting, stopping and removing the container.

You can also toggle the container [webhook](webhooks.md), view the [container logs](logs.md), [inspect](inspect.md) the container's configuration, view container [stats](stats.md), access the [console](console.md), and (if the container is running in interactive mode) attach to the running container.
