# Can I run Portainer on my configuration?

While we would love to say yes, there are just too many variables to consider when guaranteeing support for every possible configuration.

When releasing new versions of Portainer, we perform extensive testing on the most common configurations (see our [list of validated configurations](../../start/requirements-and-prerequisites.md#validated-configurations) for each version). Portainer may function perfectly on configurations that are not listed, but because we have not tested them, we cannot promise that they will be compatible.
