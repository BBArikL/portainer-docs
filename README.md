## About Portainer

Portainer Community Edition (CE) is our foundation. With over half a million regular users, CE is a powerful, open source toolset that allows you to easily build and manage containers in Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Azure ACI.

Portainer hides the complexity of managing containers behind an easy-to-use UI. By removing the need to use the CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, Portainer makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so easy that anyone can do it.

Our team is here to help you on your journey. Engage with them any time through our community-based support channels.

## Documentation

We're working hard to ensure that our documentation keeps up with our ever-growing Portainer community. If you have a question or a task, we encourage you to start with the documentation (right here!). If you can't find what you're looking for, please visit one of our support channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
As an open source product we rely on users in our community to support one another by asking questions, engaging in discussions and sharing knowledge. Together with the documentation found on this site and our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7diMJcrULjDseq5yhSUZgg), we cover a lot of ground but there may be gaps.

## Community and support channels

Other platforms exist (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow) but we are less active in those spaces.
* **Log bugs** in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues) so they can be properly managed.
