## How do I report a bug?

If you find a bug, please tell us so we can triage it. All bugs are managed in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=bug%2Fneed-confirmation%2C+kind%2Fbug\&template=Bug\_report.md\&title=). When you click through, our template makes it easy to record all of the details. Before you report a bug, please check our list of [open bugs](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2Fbug) in case someone else has already reported it.

Go [here](contributing.md#how-do-you-decide-which-bugs-and-features-to-work-on-first) to learn how we prioritize bug fixes.

## How do I raise a feature request?

You can request new features in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=\&template=Feature\_request.md\&title=). When you click through, our template makes it easy to record all of the details. We also publish a [list of open feature requests](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug%2Fconfirmed) in GitHub. Check to see if someone has already requested the feature you want, and give it a thumbs up.

## How do you decide which bugs and features to work on first?

Here at Portainer, we encourage feedback from our customers, and we truly value our user community. That being said, our [features](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2Fenhancement) and [bugs](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2Fbug) lists are long and at times seem neverending. Our decision-making process aims to balance user needs with the reality of Portainer's limited time and resources. Despite our best intentions, we know that at times we will disappoint some of you.

### Our process

When prioritizing which feature requests to work on, if we answer "yes" to any of the following questions, we will add that feature:

* Will it address a security vulnerability or potential exploitation?
* Will it have a wide appeal?
* Will it benefit professional Portainer users?
* Does the request have at least 20 thumbs-ups or hearts in GitHub?

### Feature parity

We don't automatically maintain feature parity with Docker. When a new Docker CE feature comes out, we ask the same four questions before deciding whether or not to add it to Portainer. And we only add support for features that we feel are in high demand.

### The importance of voting

We receive many feature requests for issues that exist only because of a specific use case. These stay pending until we identify an opportunity, or our community indicates its demand by voting (thumbs-up).

## How do I log a support ticket?

### Fast facts about Portainer support

* Only Portainer Business (BE) customers can log tickets directly with Portainer.
* Tickets are logged via the [Portainer Business Support portal](https://support.portainer.io/?login=1).
* A login was provided with your BE license. If you don't have a login and feel you should, email [success@portainer.io](mailto:success@portainer.io?subject=Access%20to%20Portainer%20Business%20Support).
* The portal can be used to report a bug, ask a question, tell us about an issue with documentation, or request a feature. You can also view your open tickets in the portal.
* Tickets are checked and resolved by Portainer staff within the SLA.

### How to log a support ticket

1. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Submit Ticket**.
2. Complete the form, providing as much detail as possible (we love screenshots!) then submit.
3. Ticket updates are managed in the portal (you'll also receive an email notification).

If we think it's easier to speak to you about a ticket, we'll set up a Zoom meeting.
{% endhint %}

### How to view your tickets

You can view your tickets in the main dashboard. You will not be able to view tickets logged by other people in your organization.
