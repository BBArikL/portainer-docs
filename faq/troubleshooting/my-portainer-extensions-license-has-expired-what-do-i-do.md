# My Portainer Extensions license has expired. What can I do?

In December 2020, Portainer stopped the extensions program as part of the release of Portainer 2.0. The RBAC capability offered with extensions was replaced with the dedicated Business Edition. As a Portainer Extensions user, you have two options:

### Option 1: Upgrade to Portainer Business 2.0

A free upgrade for previous Portainer Extensions customers is available but comes with no support agreement. Click [here](mailto:info@portainer.io?subject=Request%20to%20upgrade%20from%20Extensions%20to%20Portainer%20Business) to request a license or [reach out to our team](https://www.portainer.io/contact) for more information on upgrading to Portainer Business with full support.

### Option 2: Remain on version 1.24.x

If you wish to remain on the CE edition, click [here](mailto:support@portainer.io?subject=Extensions%20License) to request a 10-year license key. You will need to tell us which extensions you require licenses for. Please be aware that version 1.24.x is no longer receiving updates.
