# View Container Stats

Stats are very important to understand the resource consumption of your containers. In Portainer, you are able to monitor this from the UI.

Here, you can view a very comprehensive list of consumption stats:

* Memory Usage
* CPU Usage
* Network Usage: RX and TX
* I/O Usage
* Processes running in the container

You can also configure the refresh rate of the displayed stats from the dropdown box.
